## VC.ru feed layout

I tried to redo a feed layout of popular in Russia news site [vc.ru](https://vc.ru). It took me 50 minutes to do it all. The hardest part was allying center and still have margin-left: 5px; of "Kripta" word =).

Right now I didn't make icons at the bottom because I think that I can do it and I don't need practice.
